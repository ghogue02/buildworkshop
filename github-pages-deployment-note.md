# Important Note About GitHub Pages Deployment

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented all the necessary fixes to resolve the GitHub Pages deployment issues:

1. Updated `.env.production` to include `PUBLIC_URL=.`
2. Updated `package.json` to use a relative path for the homepage
3. Created a `fix-paths.js` script to modify the paths in the built files
4. Updated `deploy.js` to run the fix-paths.js script before deploying
5. Created a `fix-and-deploy.sh` script to automate the deployment process

The deployment script ran successfully, and the site was published to GitHub Pages.

## Why You Might Still See a 404 Error

If you're still seeing a 404 error when visiting https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/, this is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. **GitHub Pages Needs Time to Update**: GitHub Pages can take up to 10-15 minutes to build and deploy your site after pushing to the gh-pages branch. This is especially true for first-time deployments or significant changes.

2. **Browser Cache**: Your browser might be caching the old version of the site. Try clearing your browser cache or opening the site in an incognito/private window.

3. **GitHub Pages Settings**: The GitHub Pages settings in your repository might need to be verified. Go to your repository on GitHub, click on "Settings" > "Pages", and ensure it's set to deploy from the "gh-pages" branch.

## Next Steps

1. **Wait 10-15 Minutes**: Give GitHub Pages some time to build and deploy your site.

2. **Try Again**: After waiting, try accessing https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/ again.

3. **Check Repository Settings**: If the site is still not available, check your GitHub repository settings to ensure GitHub Pages is properly configured.

4. **Future Deployments**: For all future deployments, use the `./fix-and-deploy.sh` script to ensure your site is built and deployed correctly with all the necessary fixes.

## Verification

You can verify that the gh-pages branch was updated by checking your repository on GitHub. The gh-pages branch should have been updated with the latest build of your site, including all the fixes we implemented.

The deployment process was successful, and the site should be available soon if it isn't already.
