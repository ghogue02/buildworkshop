# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## The Problem

Your GitHub Pages deployment was encountering 404 errors for critical resources:

```
GET https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/static/css/main.e6c13ad2.css 404 (Not Found)
GET https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/env-config.js 404 (Not Found)
GET https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/static/js/main.ef9a0679.js 404 (Not Found)
GET https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/manifest.json 404 (Not Found)
```

This is a common issue with React applications deployed to GitHub Pages. The problem occurs because React is building the app with absolute paths instead of relative paths, which doesn't work correctly with GitHub Pages.

## The Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers to ensure your GitHub Pages deployment works correctly:

1. **Updated `.env.production`** to include `PUBLIC_URL=.`
   - This tells React to use relative paths when building the app

2. **Updated `package.json`** to use a relative path for the homepage
   - Changed from `"homepage": "https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/"` to `"homepage": "."`

3. **Created a `fix-paths.js` script** that:
   - Modifies the paths in the built files to use relative paths
   - Fixes paths in index.html, 404.html, and asset-manifest.json

4. **Updated `deploy.js`** to run the fix-paths.js script before deploying

5. **Created a `fix-and-deploy.sh` script** to:
   - Make the fix-paths.js script executable
   - Run the deployment script

## How to Deploy

To deploy your site with these fixes:

```bash
./fix-and-deploy.sh
```

This will:
1. Build your React application
2. Fix the paths in the built files
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Why This Works

The combination of these changes ensures that:

1. React builds the app with relative paths (`PUBLIC_URL=.` and `"homepage": "."`)
2. Any remaining absolute paths are fixed by the fix-paths.js script
3. The deployment process is automated with the fix-and-deploy.sh script

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 404 errors after deploying:

1. **Wait a few minutes** - GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to update
2. **Clear your browser cache** or try an incognito window
3. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
4. **Verify GitHub Pages settings** in your repository settings

## Future Deployments

For all future deployments, use:

```bash
./fix-and-deploy.sh
```

This will ensure that your site is built and deployed correctly with all the necessary fixes.
