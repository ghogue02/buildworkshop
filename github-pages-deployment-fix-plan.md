# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Plan

## Current Issue
You're encountering this error when trying to push to GitHub:
```
! [remote rejected] main -> main (refusing to allow a Personal Access Token to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` without `workflow` scope)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ghogue02/buildworkshop.git'
```

This is happening because your Personal Access Token (PAT) doesn't have the necessary permissions to update workflow files.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Your Personal Access Token (Recommended)
Create a new PAT with the `workflow` scope:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens (or Classic tokens)
2. Generate a new token with the `workflow` scope included
3. Update your local Git credentials to use this new token

**Pros:** Maintains your current setup with GitHub Actions
**Cons:** Requires updating your token

### Option 2: Remove the Workflow File from Git Tracking
If you prefer to use the local deployment method (`npm run deploy`):

1. Remove the workflow file from Git tracking:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   ```
2. Add it to .gitignore:
   ```
   # GitHub Actions
   .github/workflows/
   ```
3. Commit and push these changes:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Remove GitHub workflow from Git tracking"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. For future deployments, use `npm run deploy` instead of pushing to main

**Pros:** No need to update your PAT
**Cons:** Loses automatic deployment on push to main

### Option 3: Use Local Deployment Only
If you want to simplify your deployment process:

1. Delete the workflow file locally:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .github/workflows/
   ```
2. Commit and push these changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove GitHub Actions workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. For future deployments, use `npm run deploy`

**Pros:** Simplifies your deployment process
**Cons:** Loses automatic deployment on push to main

## Recommended Approach

Option 1 is recommended if you want to maintain your current setup with automatic deployments.

Option 2 or 3 is recommended if you prefer to use the local deployment method and don't need automatic deployments.

## After Fixing the Issue

Once you've resolved the token issue, you can push your original changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove video component and OpenAI API key references"
git push origin main
```

Or if you've chosen Option 2 or 3, you can deploy directly:
```bash
npm run deploy
