# Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a real-time dashboard for administrators to monitor all Builders' inputs across the workshop platform.

## Core Features

### Real-time Data Sync
- Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Subscribe to user_inputs table changes
- Update dashboard immediately when builders submit data
- Show live status indicators for active builders

### Data Organization
- Group inputs by builder (name/email)
- Organize sections chronologically:
  * User Info
  * Problem Definition
  * MVP Planner
  * Give & Get Feedback
  * Refine Your MVP
  * Start Build
  * Presentations & Retro

### UI Components

#### Builder Overview
- List of all builders
- Quick stats per builder:
  * Sections completed
  * Current section
  * Last update time
- Filter/search builders

#### Section Data Display
- Collapsible sections per builder
- Card-based layout for each section
- Progress indicators
- Timestamp for each update

#### Navigation & Filtering
- Filter by section
- Filter by completion status
- Search by builder name/email
- Sort options (alphabetical, recent updates)

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
src/
  components/
    admin/
      AdminDashboard.js       # Main dashboard component
      BuilderList.js          # Builder navigation/filtering
      BuilderDetails.js       # Individual builder's data
      SectionCard.js          # Section data display
      StatusIndicator.js      # Real-time status component
```

### Data Management
- Use Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Group data by session_id
- Join with user info for builder details
- Cache data locally for performance
- Update specific sections on changes

### Routing
- Add /admin route
- Protect route with admin authentication
- Allow deep linking to specific builders

### UI/UX Design
- Dark theme matching main app
- Grid layout for efficient space use
- Collapsible sections for focus
- Visual indicators for:
  * New updates
  * Complete vs incomplete sections
  * Active builders

## Security
- Implement admin-only access
- Add authentication check
- Secure Supabase policies for admin access

## Next Steps
1. Create basic component structure
2. Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions
3. Build UI components
4. Add filtering and navigation
5. Implement security measures
6. Test with multiple concurrent users
7. Deploy and monitor performance
