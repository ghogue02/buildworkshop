# Analysis of Application Loading Issues

After examining the codebase, I've identified several potential issues that could be causing the application to not load properly after removing some components. Here's my analysis:

## Key Findings

1. **Removed Components**: Comments in BuilderView.js indicate that "AI Interview, Video Reflection and Review sections" were removed, but there might still be references to these components in the code.

2. **Console Errors**: The console logs show issues with MVPPlanner and GiveGetFeedback components:
   - Both components are trying to fetch data from Supabase but receiving "No data or empty data returned"
   - Components are unmounting with `isMounted set to false`

3. **Supabase Configuration**: The Supabase configuration in env-config.js appears correct, but there might be issues with how components interact with it.

4. **React Version**: The project is using React 19.0.0, which is very recent and might have compatibility issues with other dependencies.

## Potential Root Causes

1. **Component Dependencies**: The removed components might have been providing context or data that other components depend on.

2. **Supabase Connection Issues**: The error logs suggest problems with Supabase data fetching, which could be due to:
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Database permissions or configuration problems
   - Incorrect session handling after component removal

3. **React Lifecycle Issues**: The console shows components unmounting unexpectedly, which could indicate problems with component lifecycle management after the removals.

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Restore Component References**: Check for and fix any broken references to the removed components in BuilderView.js and other files.

2. **Fix Session Handling**: Ensure session management is working correctly after component removals.

3. **Update Component Dependencies**: Modify components to handle cases where previously dependent components are no longer available.

4. **Test Supabase Connection**: Verify the Supabase connection is working correctly and data can be fetched.

5. **Consider React Version**: If necessary, downgrade React to a more stable version if compatibility issues persist.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix BuilderView.js Component References

The BuilderView.js file has comments indicating that some components were removed, but there might still be references to these components in the code. We need to:

- Check for any remaining imports of removed components
- Ensure all references to removed components are properly cleaned up
- Verify that the component state and navigation logic doesn't depend on removed components

### 2. Fix Session Handling

The session handling might be affected by the removal of components:

- Review the session management code in BuilderView.js
- Ensure that session IDs are properly generated and stored
- Check that the session ID is correctly passed to all components
- Verify that the Supabase queries are using the correct session ID

### 3. Update Component Dependencies

Components might be dependent on data or context from removed components:

- Review the data flow between components
- Modify components to handle cases where previously dependent components are no longer available
- Ensure that all components can function independently

### 4. Test Supabase Connection

The Supabase connection might be having issues:

- Verify that the Supabase URL and anonymous key are correct
- Check that the database tables and schemas are properly set up
- Test the connection with simple queries
- Review the error handling in the Supabase client code

### 5. Review React Version Compatibility

The project is using React 19.0.0, which is very recent:

- Check for compatibility issues with other dependencies
- Consider downgrading to a more stable version if necessary
- Review the React lifecycle methods used in the components

## Next Steps

After implementing these fixes, we should:

1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all components load correctly
2. Monitor the console for any remaining errors
3. Verify that data is being properly fetched from Supabase
4. Ensure that all user interactions work as expected

This plan should help resolve the loading issues and get the application working properly again.
