## Database Overview

Your application uses a Supabase database with several interconnected tables:

- **user_inputs**: Core table storing user inputs for different sections
- **admin_notes**: Stores admin notes linked to sessions
- **video_recordings**: Stores video recordings and transcripts
- **report_cache**: Stores generated reports
- **analysis_results**: Stores AI-generated insights
- **interview_sessions**: Stores interview sessions data

The tables are primarily linked through session_id, which serves as the main identifier across the application.

## Recovery Approach

The recovery approach follows these key principles:

1. **Recreate Structure First**: Rebuild the database schema using migration files
2. **Identify Existing Data**: Check what data survived the reset
3. **Restore Core Data**: Focus on the user_inputs table first
4. **Verify Relationships**: Ensure data integrity across tables
5. **Test Functionality**: Verify the application works with the recovered data

## Getting Started

To begin the recovery process, follow these steps:

1. Read the [Quick-Start Guide](database-recovery-quickstart.md) for essential steps
2. Implement the scripts from [Recovery Scripts](database-recovery-scripts.md)
3. Follow the detailed instructions in [Comprehensive Recovery Plan](database-recovery-plan.md)
4. Refer to [Database Structure Summary](database-recovery-summary.md) for understanding relationships

## Future Data Protection

After recovery, consider implementing these preventive measures:

1. Set up automated backups using Supabase dashboard
2. Implement a version control system for database schema changes
3. Create a staging environment for testing changes
4. Document database structure and relationships
5. Establish a disaster recovery plan

## Support

If you encounter issues during the recovery process:

1. Check error messages for specific problems
2. Refer to Supabase documentation for platform-specific issues
3. Review the migration files to understand the expected database structure
4. Use the debug_supabase_connection.js script to diagnose connection problems
