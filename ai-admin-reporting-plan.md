# AI-Powered Admin Reporting System

## Overview
Create a new admin page that uses AI to analyze and synthesize data from all builders, providing valuable insights into builder progress, common patterns, challenges, and successes.

## Data Structure
Currently collecting:
- User progression through 7 sections
- Individual builder inputs and progress
- Admin notes per builder
- Timestamps for all actions

## Implementation Plan
