# Fix for GitHub Pages 404 Errors

Based on the console errors, I can see that your GitHub Pages site is trying to load but can't find critical resources. This is a common issue with React apps deployed to GitHub Pages, especially when using the `gh-pages` package.

## The Problem

The resources are being requested at:
- https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/static/css/main.e6c13ad2.css
- https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/env-config.js
- https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/static/js/main.ef9a0679.js
- https://ghogue02.github.io/builderworkshop/manifest.json

But they're returning 404 errors, which means the files exist in your gh-pages branch but aren't being served correctly.

## Solution

We need to modify your React app's build configuration to use relative paths. Here's how to fix it:

1. Create a file called `.env.production` with the following content:

```
PUBLIC_URL=.
```

2. Update your package.json to include the "homepage" field with a dot:

```json
"homepage": ".",
```

3. Re-deploy your app:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Why This Works

Setting `PUBLIC_URL=.` and `"homepage": "."` tells React to use relative paths instead of absolute paths when building the app. This means it will look for resources relative to the current URL, which works better with GitHub Pages.

## Alternative Solution

If the above doesn't work, we can create a custom deploy script that modifies the paths in the built files:

1. Create a file called `fix-paths.js`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Read the index.html file
const indexPath = path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html');
let indexContent = fs.readFileSync(indexPath, 'utf8');

// Replace absolute paths with relative paths
indexContent = indexContent.replace(/href="\/builderworkshop\//g, 'href="./');
indexContent = indexContent.replace(/src="\/builderworkshop\//g, 'src="./');

// Write the modified content back to index.html
fs.writeFileSync(indexPath, indexContent);

console.log('Paths fixed in index.html');
```

2. Update your deploy script in package.json:

```json
"deploy": "react-scripts build && node fix-paths.js && gh-pages -d build"
```

3. Re-deploy your app:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Checking Your Current Setup

Let's verify your current configuration:

1. Check if you have a PUBLIC_URL set in any .env files
2. Verify the "homepage" field in package.json
3. Look at the paths in your built index.html file

Once we've made these changes, your GitHub Pages site should load correctly without 404 errors.
